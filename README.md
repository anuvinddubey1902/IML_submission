❤️ Heart Disease Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data. It is designed to assist healthcare professionals by providing fast and accurate predictions from key medical features.

📌 Project Overview
Goal: Predict whether a patient has heart disease.

Dataset: UCI Heart Disease Dataset (processed version).

Models Used:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Best Model: Displayed with highest accuracy after evaluation.

Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

🧰 Tech Stack
Python 🐍

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn
